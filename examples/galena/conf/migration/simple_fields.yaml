# This is the Galena simple example migration field mapping file.
# Each entry is in the format:
#   heading: paths
# The heading is the CSV file label in the leading heading record.
# The paths is a comma-separated list of CaTissue domain object attribute paths specifying
# how the CSV heading maps to a CaTissue attribute value. Each attribute path is in the format:
#   class.attribute[.attribute]
# where class is a CaTissue class and attribute is a Ruby accessor method defined in the CaTissue class.
# The accessor method can be one of the following:
# * a Java property name, e.g. lastName
# * the pre-defined Rubyized underscore form of the Java property, e.g. last_name

# The collection protocol title for the specimen
Protocol: CollectionProtocol.title

# The input MRN field is used for the PMI MRN, CPR PPI and Participant last name.
# Since the migration source is for a single collection site, the MRN is unique within the protocol.
# The simple input does not have a Participant name field. It is a useful practice to set the caTissue
# name to some value, since caTissue uses the name for display and sorting. For want of a better
# value, the name is set to the MRN.
MRN: ParticipantMedicalIdentifier.medical_record_number, Participant.last_name

# The input SPN field is the SCG SPN value.
SPN: SpecimenCollectionGroup.surgical_pathology_number

# The input Collection Date is the Specimen received timestamp.
Collection Date: ReceivedEventParameters.timestamp

# The input Quantity is the target Specimen initial quantity.
Quantity: Specimen.initial_quantity
