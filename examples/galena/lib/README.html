<h1>Galena Cancer Center Tissue Bank Migrator example</h1>
<p>
This migration example demonstrates how to load the content of a hypothetical
custom tissue bank into caTissue. The use case illustrates several common
migration impediments:
<ul>
<li>Different terminology than caTissue
<li>Different associations than caTissue
<li>Incomplete input for caTissue
<li>Denormalized input
<li>Inconsistent input
<li>Input data scrubbing
<li>Aliquot inference
<li>Pre-defined caTissue protocol
</ul>
These migration features are described in the migration process below.

<h2>Input data</h2>
<p>
The hypothetical Galena Tissue Bank data resides in the <tt>data/galena.csv</tt>
CSV file included in the example. The CSV file holds one row for each specimen.
The fields are as follows:
<dl>
<dt>MRN</dt><dd>Patient Medical Record Number</dd>
<dt>Initials</dt><dd>Patient name initials</dd>
<dt>Frozen?</dt><dd>Flag indicating whether the specimen is frozen</dd>
<dt>SPN</dt><dd>Surgical Pathology Number</dd>
<dt>Collection Date</dt><dd>Specimen date of collection</dd>
<dt>Quantity</dt><dd>Amount collected</dd>
</dl>
